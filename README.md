# Java-ProjectsAndUnit-Tests
Here will be some of my project. Maybe even Unit-Test for them. 
Ideas not original, but my own realisation.
Projects:
  Calculator - just simple calculator.
  Reverse string - literally reverse string.

Number guessing mini game:
  You shoud try to guess random number 0-10.
  There is 4 difficulty, harder = less tries.
  After each try the program will tell you whether your number is higher or lower than random.
Have fun! 

Unit Tests for this mini-projects will be added soon(or not:|).
